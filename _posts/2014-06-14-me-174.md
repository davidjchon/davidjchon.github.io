### Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design and construct a truss bridge within consraints outlined in **Specifications**.  Requirements for the project:

1. Agreement between predicted & measured failure loads for constructed bridge
2. Measured structural efficiency of the constructed bridge

<!-- more -->

### Specifications
Bridge will be constructed using a total of 25 plastic drinking straws.  Specifications and constraints will be as follows:

1. **Design:**
   * 12 inch span and 2 inch max width
   * Loading apparatus will provide 1 inch wide abutments on eithe rside of span for bridge to rest upon
   * Must be self-standing and function without attachment to loading apparatus
   * Must accomodate loading at mid-span. Weights will be loaded using 3/16 inch x 2.5 inch, transversely-oriented rod.  Wires attached to rod ends will connect to hanging weight beneath bridge.
   * No portion of the bridge may extend beneath plane defined by upper abutment surfaces.
   * Bridges must be trusses, not simple beams based on bundled straws
   * Straws can be cut to desired length, but may not be slit open to form webbing or gusseting
2. **Construction:**
   * Use of any other materieals is not permitted; nor are pins, tape, gussets, or other means of joining/support
   * Strongly encouraged to reinforce area around mid-span loading point to ensure that local deformation does not compromise bridge load-bearing performance unduly

**Group Members:**
David&nbsp;Chon, Andrew&nbsp;Chow, Clayton&nbsp;Chow, Jeffrey&nbsp;Chung, Alexander&nbsp;Decker

The first plan was to come to a consensus on which type of bridge to create.  Most of the members had a good understanding of the different types of truss bridges: *Warren, Pratt, Howe and K* Truss bridge.  After further research online, the group came to an agreement on building the Warren bridge with a slight modification; by adding a support beam in the dead center.
