### Objectives
Design and construct a truss bridge within consraints outlined in **Specifications**.  Requirements for the project:

1. Agreement between predicted & measured failure loads for constructed bridge
2. Measured structural efficiency of the constructed bridge

<!-- more -->

### Specifications
Bridge will be constructed using a total of 25 plastic drinking straws.  Specifications and constraints will be as follows:

1. **Design:**
   * 12 inch span and 2 inch max width
   * Loading apparatus will provide 1 inch wide abutments on eithe rside of span for bridge to rest upon
   * Must be self-standing and function without attachment to loading apparatus
   * Must accomodate loading at mid-span. Weights will be loaded using 3/16 inch x 2.5 inch, transversely-oriented rod.  Wires attached to rod ends will connect to hanging weight beneath bridge.
   * No portion of the bridge may extend beneath plane defined by upper abutment surfaces.
   * Bridges must be trusses, not simple beams based on bundled straws
   * Straws can be cut to desired length, but may not be slit open to form webbing or gusseting
2. **Construction:**
   * Use of any other materieals is not permitted; nor are pins, tape, gussets, or other means of joining/support
   * Strongly encouraged to reinforce area around mid-span loading point to ensure that local deformation does not compromise bridge load-bearing performance unduly
