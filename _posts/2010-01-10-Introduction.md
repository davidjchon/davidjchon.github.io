Welcome! 환영합니다! ようこそ!<br/>
My name is **David J. Chon** and this is my business blog.

I am a Mechanical Engineer with a focus on **Design and Manufacturing** and **Materials and Structures**. I believe that having a well structured and organized plan of action can effeciently produce any product that engineers design.  

This blog will usually contain most of my projects from school and my projects inside (if allowed) and outside of work however, I will occasionally include some of the skills I learned on my own.  I hope you enjoy reading about the rewards and struggles along my journey called life.
