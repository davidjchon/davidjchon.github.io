### Introduction
What is HTML? HTML is also known as a **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage.  HTML describes the structure of web pages using 'markup'.  The 'markup' language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distiguishable from the text.  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.  These elements are represented by tags which label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. The tags or categories are classified by putting <> around the element type.

* <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defiens this document to be HTML5
* <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
* <head> element contains meta information about the document
* <title> element specifies a title for the document
* <body> element contains the visible page content
* <h1> element defines a large heading
* <p> element defines a paragraph
